AI-Powered Text Summarizer Project README
AI-Powered Text Summarizer
Project Overview
The AI-Powered Text Summarizer is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that generates concise, coherent summaries of long text documents. The goal of the project is to implement an extractive text summarization model that selects important sentences or phrases from the original text to create a summary.

Features
Extractive Text Summarization: Selects important sentences/phrases from the original text to create a summary.
NLP-based Implementation: Uses advanced NLP libraries like NLTK and Hugging Face transformers for text processing and summarization.
Python Implementation: The project is implemented using Python and popular NLP libraries.
Installation
Clone the Repository Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Powered-Text-Summarizer.git
Install Required Libraries Install the necessary libraries by running:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download NLTK Resources If you're using NLTK, you need to download the required resources:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Usage
Running the Summarizer
To run the text summarizer, pass your text to the summarizer function in the code.

Customization
You can adjust the summarizer settings to generate summaries of different lengths or experiment with different NLP models as needed.

Results
The AI-powered text summarizer generates meaningful summaries by extracting key information from the original content, making it easier to digest large documents.
